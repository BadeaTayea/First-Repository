# Introduction to Fourier Transforms in the Context of Seismology:

In short, the Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that decomposes a waveform into an alternate representation based on summations of sine and cosine signals. Regardless of how “jagged” the original waveform is, the established sum of sines and cosines forms a smooth curve that largely maintains the overall properties of the waveform.

Fourier Transforms give way to a new representation of the waveform which lies in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. With that, the entire waveform could be visualized in terms of individual component frequencies, and the waveform could be analyzed and studied more lucidly.

Fourier Transforms are hugely beneficial in countless fields of science and engineering. In particular, the Fourier representation of seismic signals in Seismology provides a framework for determining and reconstructing some obscure or hidden aspects of seismic data from within distorted/noisy recorded signals, allowing applications ranging from accurate earthquake detections to sensitive early warning systems.
