## Notes:
- Save Figures to GitHub
- Terms marked in bold (overfitting, underfitting, and son)
- Create Summary Page 
- Maybe later: Update this page by going through other resources and adding on the notebooks until you have a tutorial folder collecting the best information, explanation, and methods of instruction from the best of these resources. (Trello Resources + Videos on YouTube)
- Self-Explanatory + GIFs later maybe + New Code Hacks (such as: plt.save or plt.title($y_1$, rotation=0 or for loops with styles, colors, width, and so on) 
- Try many exercies and examples on your own: active recall and practice tests
- Paraphrase contents of PHYS491 + Fix Code
