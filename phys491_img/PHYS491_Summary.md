# Classification: Predicting Categorical Data 
- **Usage:** Classification is concerned with predicting the classes, or labels, of a data sample based on its features.  
- **Example Applications:**
  - Recognizing hand-written digits
  - Marking Emails: Spam / Non-Spam 
  - Image Classification: Human / Animal
- **Types:**
  - Binary Classification
  - Multi-Class Clasification
  - Multi-Label Classification
  - Imbalanced Classification
 ## Binary Classification with SciKit Learn:
  - Given: Two Class Labels (One class is assigned label:0; the other is assigned label:1)
  - Popular Algorithms that can be used for binary classification:
    - Logistic Rergession 
    - k-Nearest Neigbors 
    - Decision Trees 
    - Support Vector Machines 
    - Naive Bayes
  - Worked Example: 
    - Training a Binary Classifier to identify a given image from the MNIST dataset as a 5 or not:
